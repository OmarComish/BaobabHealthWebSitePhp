                      <p>BHT operates within strict legal and ethical boundaries, and encourage the same to all our cooperating partners. We strongly believe in using locals (Malawians) to solve their own challenges and we do this through a rigorous capacity building program for our staff and implementing partners.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text_highlight">Our Approach</div>
                    <div class="about_text">
                      <p> All we do is the vision of the Malawi government as stipulated in the National ICT Policy and the MoH HIS strategy (2013) which focuses on improving the application of ICT in health service delivery. We share the common vision that data is the bedrock for strategic planning and and scaling up of various interventions to address specific health problems while keeping in focus of the national goals as enshrined in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy. All systems are vetted and approved by the Malawi government before they get introduced to health workers and it is that close working relationship which we continue to build on to scale our interventions.</p>
                      <p> Besides the Ministry of health we also work with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Internal Security through the National Registration Bureau (NRB) whose electronic Death and Birth registration systems we have developed. In order to encourage knowledge sharing and continuous development of the EMR, BHT uses and follows free and open source software (FOSS) standards. BHT innovations includes technologies that operate in environments characterised by power failures; dusty conditions; health care users that have not used any information and communication technology before. The scenarios have translated into BHT using low power consumption devices; green power back up strategies including solar and wind power sources in facilities off the national electricity grid; solid state hard drives; and intuitive touch screen user interfaces that encourage steep learning curves for health care providers.</p>
